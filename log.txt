Created user on Jetson with sudo using adduser and changin viduso file
Installed OpenCV 2.4.11 from homepage
Tested OpenCV (not sure if should have installed CVforTegra)
Wrote a basic cpp program to read an image..SUCCESS (image file name case sensitive)
Built a build.sh and used "chmod 777" to make it an executable to compile the cpp file

4/15/15
Built a program to capture the red ball from original image

4/22/15 
Working on this project again after a busy week..
Working on getting the webcam to capture live image..
Built a simple python program to test webcam
"can't find cv" error
Installed libraries for python-openCV
python file runs
CPP files won't compile now because they can't find the libraries..
Re-installing openCV, using OpenCV-for-Tegra this time
CPP files compile and run correctly
Errors with python "can't find cv" 
Guess the libraries over lap and can only choose one
Added -lopencv_gpu library to the shell to fix a gpu error

Today's goal is to capture red object in video and draw a square around it
Got highgui error when running tracking bars
Completely uninstalled opencv for a clean install 
Libraries kill or delete each other, what a shame
Spent time figuring out why control bars wouldn't work
Accidentaly renamed a parameter and forgot to rename the other parts in the program, shame on me
Calculated the moment of pixels and identified the center
Drew a line to track the center 
Good progress

Today's goal is to print out x and y coordinate
Online it says countNonZero is to count black pixels
Howverm, I just checked and it counts white pixels, 
which makes sense because black = 0 and white = 1
Turns out I already got the coordinate
Moving on to using GPU and socket

4/27/15
Able to use GPU for HSV conversion
Couldn't find matching gpu multi-channel thresholding function
to port "inrage()" to gpu
Implementing socket before coming back to threshold

4/29/15
Socket program tested
Implementing socket into my main program

4/30/15
Finishing up socket
Going to convert several functions to GPU ones
Maybe implementing rt_task
